# Code of Conduct

## Introduction
In the interest of fostering a respectful and supportive environment, we contributors are committed to ensuring a harrassment-free experience for all, regardless of background or identity. This code of conduct applies to all spaces in which the group is involved in including, but not limited to, group meetings (online or in-person), written communication, and online discussions.

## Expected Behavior
All interactions are expected to be professional, showing respect and courtesy, to help create the environment this Code of Conduct is designed to uphold. Additional examples of expected behaviors include the following:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

## Unacceptable Behavior
Examples of unacceptable behavior by any of the group members include:
- Written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
- Causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
- Violent threats or language directed against another person
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
- Sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- Insults or put downs
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- Incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
Individuals who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. Violations of the Code of Conduct will first be addressed within the project group. If the issue cannot be resolved internally, it will be escalated to the DSCI310 teaching team for further action.
